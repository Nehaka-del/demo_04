 ✨ My Contribution: Contact Page

As part of this project, I was responsible for designing and developing the **Contact Page**, ensuring it is accessible, responsive, and stylistically consistent with the overall website.

📄 Files Created

- `cp.html` – Contains the HTML structure for the Contact Page
- `style.css` – Includes styles specifically for the contact form and layout

 🌿 Branching Workflow

I followed a structured Git workflow using feature branches to manage and improve the Contact Page iteratively.

 🔨 Step-by-Step Git Workflow

1. Started in the `master` branch:
   
   git checkout master
   vi cp.html style.css
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add initial Contact Page files"

2. Branches

| Branch | Purpose                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `B1`   | Created basic form layout in `cp.html`        |
| `B2`   | Added responsive styling in `style.css`       |
| `B3`   | Implemented accessibility and form validation |
| `B4`   | Final design cleanup and minor UI adjustments |

3. Merging

git merge B1
git merge B2
